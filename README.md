# Linear-Rgeression-with-IRIS-dataset

The Iris flower dataset is a multivariate. 
It is a typical testcase for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning.

The dataset contains 3 classes (different Iris species) with 50 samples each. There are four numeric properties about those classes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

In total there are 150 records under five attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and species.

One species, Iris Setosa, is "linearly separable" from the other two species. 
This means that we can draw a line (or a hyperplane in higher-dimensional spaces) between Iris Setosa samples and samples corresponding to the other two species.
